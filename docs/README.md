# Fire

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FireFather/fire/master/docs/fire.png)

a strong, state-of-the-art, highly optimized, open-source freeware UCI chess engine...
designed and programmed for modern 64-bit windows and linux systems
by Norman Schmidt


## features
- c++17
- windows & linux
- uci
- 64-bit
- smp (to 256 threads)
- configurable hash (to 1024 GB)
- ponder
- multiPV
- analysis (infinite) mode
- chess960 (Fischer Random)
- syzygy tablebases
- adjustable contempt setting
- fast perft & divide
- bench (includes ttd time-to-depth calculation)
- integrated tuner (if compiled with #define TUNER)
- timestamped bench, perft/divide, and tuner logs
- asychronous cout (acout) class using std::unique_lock<std::mutex>


Fire 8 has undergone months of meticulous analysis and refactoring using many of the most modern C++ tools available today, including Clang, ReSharper C++, and Visual Studio Code Analysis, ensuring the production of extremely fast highly optimized and stable executables.


## strength
Fire 8 has been thoroughly tested by the CCRL testing group:
- ~3550 Elo on [CCRL Blitz](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404/)
- ~3400 Elo on [CCRL 40/15](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/)
- ~3600 Elo on [CCRL 40/2 FRC](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404FRC/)

Fire appears to be superior to Ethereal and Houdini at fast time controls (like 40/4), but really shines at ultra-fast TCs like 1000ms + 100 ms (avg. game 14 secs)


| engine         | games    | win      | loss     | draw      | timeouts  | win%      | elo      | los        
| :------------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------:  | :------:  | :------:  | :------: | :------:  
| Fire 8.1       | 5697     | +2334    | -1221    | =2142     | 0         | 59.8%     | +70 elo  | 100%
| Ethereal 2.75  | 5697     | +1221    | -2334    | =2142     | 0         | 40.2%     | -70 elo  | 0%


## available binaries
- **x64 popc** = fast pgo binary (for modern 64-bit systems w/ popcnt instruction set)
- **x64 pext** = fast pgo binary (for modern 64-bit systems w/ BMI2 instruction set) if you own a Intel Haswell or newer cpu, this compile should be faster.

- **windows** : Fire_8.11_x64_popc.exe or Fire_8.11_x64_pext.exe
- **linux** :   Fire_8.11_x64_popc or Fire_8.11_x64_pext


run 'bench' at command line to determine which binary runs best/fastest on your system. for greater accuracy, run it twice and calculate the average of both results.


please see **http://chesslogik.wix.com/fire** for more info

## compile it yourself
- **windows** (visual studio) use included project files Fire.vcxproj or Fire.sln
- **minGW** run included bash scripts makefire_pext.sh or makefire_popc.sh
- **ubuntu** type 'make profile-build ARCH=x86-64-pext' or 'make profile-build ARCH=x86-64-popc'

## uci options
- **Hash** size of the hash table. default is 64 MB.
- **Threads** number of processor threads to use. default is 1, max = 128.
- **MultiPV** number of pv's/principal variations (lines of play) to be output. default is 1.
- **Contempt** higher contempt resists draws.
- **Ponder** also think during opponent's time. default is false.
- **UCI_Chess960** play chess960 (often called FRC or Fischer Random Chess). default is false.
- **Clear Hash** clear the hash table. delete allocated memory and re-initialize.
- **SyzygyProbeDepth** engine begins probing at specified depth. increasing this option makes the engine probe less.
- **SyzygyProbeLimit** number of pieces that have to be on the board in the endgame before the table-bases are probed.
- **Syzygy50MoveRule** set to false, tablebase positions that are drawn by the 50-move rule will count as a win or loss.
- **SyzygyPath** path to the syzygy tablebase files.
